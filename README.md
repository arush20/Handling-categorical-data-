## Introduction

Categorical data, while ubiquitous in datasets, presents unique challenges in machine learning workflows. Properly encoding these variables can drastically affect the performance of models. This repository serves as a guide to various encoding techniques, highlighting their use-cases, advantages, and disadvantages.

## Requirements

1. Python (Version 3.x recommended)
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Libraries:
   - Pandas
   - Scikit-learn
   (Install them using pip)

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```
   cd directory_name
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. Open the Jupyter notebook(s) provided and delve into the world of categorical data encoding!

## Encoding Techniques Covered

- **One-Hot Encoding**: Useful for nominal categorical variables without a natural order.
- **Label Encoding**: Best suited for ordinal categorical variables.
- **Probability Encoding**: Captures the probability of a category affecting the target variable.
